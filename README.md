sublime-growth
==============

Rails app that simulates the growth of a population of bacteria. It's like Conway's Game of Life but it uses full RGB values.

You can upload arbitrary images and specify your own formula. The program then iteratively calculates the next frame of the image using your formula. 

You will get colorful and absolutely stylish looking images :D

The whole thing is implemented using the ```<canvas>``` element. You can save the canvas' state to a png image at any point.
